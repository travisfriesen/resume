# Resume Creator
This is a program that I am using to learn some python, it allows for customizable resumes for different circumstances using resume config subsets. This also allows you to keep all your job experience, projects, education and potentially more in one place, and easily export resumes (hopefully) using github actions or python running on your local machine.
